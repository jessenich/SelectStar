## Introduction

Query SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSql, SQLite, & mySql natively with PowerShell.

The basic pattern is to connect to a database, invoke one or more sql statements and then close your database connection. This module provides cmdlets that map to this basic pattern.  Each Provider has its own 'Open-*Connection' cmdlet, but the remaining cmdlets are provider agnostic (MSSQL: Open-SqlConnection, Oracle: Open-OracleConnection, SQLite: Open-SQLiteConnection, etc).  You can have multiple connections open, just distinguish them through the use of the -ConnectionName parameter on every command (if no ConnectionName is specified, it defaults to 'default').

```Powershell
    Open-*Connection -DataSource "SomeServer" -InitialCatalog "SomeDB"
    $data = Invoke-SqlQuery -query "SELECT * FROM someTable"

    #or using parameters
    $data = Invoke-SqlQuery -query "SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE someCol = @var" -Parameters @{var = 'a value'}
    Close-SqlConnection
```
